# giphyAPI
This app is to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of all favorite Japanese animes. 

When the user clicks on a button of favorite anime, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) should be displayed.

Enjoy this JP app!
